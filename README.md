# Mieplot-UX-Improvement

In order to improve the usability of the Mie Plot on [saviot.cnrs.fr/mie](https://saviot.cnrs.fr/mie/index.en.html) I created this addon, which simply adds two sliders. This allows the user to easily sweep through different sizes of particles and different values for the index of refraction of the surrounding medium.

## Install

I only created a proper addon for Firefox. You can install the Addon from the releases page [here on Github](https://github.com/JulianKauth/Mieplot-UX-Improvement/releases/tag/v1.2), or via the [mozilla addon site](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/better-ux-for-saviot-cnrs-fr/). The addon is still in "review" mode by Firefox, but should be accessible on the offizial addon page soon.

For Chrome you have to download the zip file from the [release](https://github.com/JulianKauth/Mieplot-UX-Improvement/releases/tag/v1.2) and unpack it. Then go to chrome://extensions/, toggle the developer mode in the top right of the page, click on "load unpacked" and select the directory you just unzipped. This will add the extension to chrome. Don't mind the red "Error" button, it doesn't influence the functionality of the addon.
